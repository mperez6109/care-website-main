                    <h1>Redefining a Site Network</h1>
                    <p>We are a unique, multi-specialty network of research sites which operates as one connected team of physician investigators, nurse coordinators, and operational managers.  In practice, we might look like a site network, but we operate as a single site with multiple branches. Our team collaborates and functions as one unit even though our work locations span five time zones. This allows us to uniquely benefit from the resources of a large institution while still staying in touch with our local communities.</p>
