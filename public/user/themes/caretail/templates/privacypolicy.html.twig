              <p class="mb-8">This Privacy Policy describes how Care Access Research LLC (“CARE”, “we”, “us” or “our”), a company with principal place of operations at 33 Arch St., 17th Floor, Boston, Mass., USA, handles Personal Information that we collect and receive from users through our websites (including, this or any other website), either automatically or information you provide.</p>
              <p class="mb-8">CARE is committed to keeping your information safe and secure. We use your Personal Information only as permitted in this Privacy Policy. By using our websites, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time by emailing us at privacyofficer@careaccessresearch.com. This privacy notice applies only to this or another CARE website. If you visit a CARE site or participate in a clinical trial, we will provide a privacy notice appropriate to that situation.</p>
              <p class="mb-8">References in this Privacy Policy to "you" or "your" refer to both you and any person or entity on whose behalf you act, if any.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-8">Purpose</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">CARE is a national network of clinical research sites. We build clinical research programs at physician practices across the U.S.A. and equip them with the resources necessary to offer clinical research as a care option for their patients. Through our Sites On Demand™ platform, sponsors can tap into patient populations in a wide range of therapeutic areas.

              <p class="mb-8">CARE does not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with third parties or non-affiliated companies, except to provide services you have requested, when we have your authorization to share such information, or when we provide the information to companies or consultants working on our behalf under confidentiality agreements. These companies and consultants do not have any independent right to share your Personal Information.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-8">Information We Collect and Use</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">The type of Personal Information that we collect and receive while you use the CARE websites or otherwise interact with CARE are described in this section and include both data that you voluntarily provide to us and data that we collect automatically when you use the CARE websites.

Personal Information is defined broadly to include any information that can relate to an individual.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-8">Information You Share with CARE</h2>
              <p class="mb-8"><strong>Data you share:</strong> If you choose to share Personal Information with CARE, you may submit additional information. This information could include your contact information or information about your health if you choose to share it.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-8">Information That May Be Collected Automatically</h2>
              <p class="mb-8"><strong>Log Data:</strong> Like many website operators, we collect information that your internet browser sends whenever you visit the CARE websites ("Log Data").

              <p class="mb-8"><strong>Cookies, pixels, and similar technologies:</strong> We also collect information about your use of CARE websites through tracking technologies such as cookies.

We do not sell this information or use it for advertising purposes.

              <h2 class="mb-8">How We Share Your Information</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">At CARE, we are careful to limit the sharing of our data. Personal Information is shared only with service providers. A service provider is an entity or individual only permitted to use your data as we instruct them. For example, we use Google Analytics for some site statistics, but Google is not permitted to share this information with anyone else. We never sell your data. However, there are a number of circumstances in which CARE could be legally obligated to share data, including;</p>
              <p class="mb-8"><strong>Lawful requests:</strong> We may be required to disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose your Personal Information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, to verify or enforce compliance with our Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
              <p class="mb-8"><strong>Corporate events:</strong> We may transfer your Personal Information to an entity or individual that acquires, buys, or merges with CARE, or our other business units. In such cases, your Personal Information would remain subject to the promises and commitments contained in this Privacy Policy until such time as this Privacy Policy is updated or amended by the acquiring party upon notice to you, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-8">De-Identified and Aggregated Information</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">In addition to the uses of Personal Information described above, we may remove the identifiable parts of your information to create de-identified forms. De-identified information may be compiled with other data in aggregated forms for product improvement purposes. For example, the data we use for analytics to monitor the use of our services or to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our websites is aggregated, meaning we cannot identify you or any other individual.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-8">Storage and Security</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">CARE stores in a secure database the Personal Information that you voluntarily provide via our online forms.
